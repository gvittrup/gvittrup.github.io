## Introduction

My name is Gunnar Vittrup, and I am currently a student at Boise State University. I recently graduated from the University of Idaho with a Bachelor's of Science in Virtual Technology & Design and an Associates in Computer Science. Now I am furthuring my education in Computer Science and I am expected to gradaute in May of 2024! For the past year, I spent my time working as a Unity developer down in Austin, Texas for a motion capturing platform to help athletes reach objective data and core insights to their movement. Now I am a research assistant at Boise State's ISPM labratory.

## Future

My plan is to finish up my second Bachelor's degree and proceed to the graduate program. I am still figuring out what I would like to specialize my degree in, but I am very much interested in Cybersecurity and AI/ML. Currently I am taking as much experience as possible, joining the VIP Informatics Skunkwork for practice with AI/ML, as well as joining the Google Student Developer Club, so I can get as much exposure and practice before I finish my degree!

## Hobbies and Interests

Even though I spend a majority of my time working at my computer, some of my favorite activities consist of being outdoors. I have always been very into snowboarding and soccer, and tend to participate in both each weekend. As of recently, I have developed a love for action photography and videography, and have been slowly trying to build my portfolio. My parents very kindly got me a Canon EOS M50 Mark II for graduating with my first degree, and ever since I have been heartfully putting it to use. Beyond that, I love camping, cooking, weight-lifting, and spending time with my friends and family.
